            [76561198275573302, ...the steamid of the rest 9 players ], 
  
  
   "76561198275573302":  # player with this steamid, it's round data
          {"steamID": 76561198275573302, 
           "map": "de_dust2", 
           "info": [[1150, 6097, "t"], ...the rest rounds 
          }, # the info [[start_tick, end_tick, side],...]
